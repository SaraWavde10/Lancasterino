# Lancaster Internship â€” DUNE Particle Shower Recognition

**Duration:** \[June 2025 to July 2025]
**Location:** Lancaster University

## Overview

During my internship at Lancaster, I collaborated with a postdoctoral researcher to optimise particle shower recognition within the Pandora reconstruction framework for the DUNE experiment at Fermilab. The aim was to enhance identification of particle shower tracks from complex detector data to improve physics analyses.

## Key Responsibilities

* Processed multi-dimensional detector data, applying spatial transformations and visualisation techniques to prepare inputs suitable for convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
* Designed and trained a TensorFlow-based binary classifier to assess interaction purity, with performance evaluated through confusion matrices and ROC curves.
* Addressed computational challenges encountered during data processing and model training to improve efficiency and accuracy.
* Presented research progress and findings to the DUNE collaboration team at Lancaster.

## Technologies & Tools

* Pandora framework (for particle reconstruction)
* TensorFlow (for machine learning model development)
* Python (data processing and visualisation)
* Data visualisation tools for multi-dimensional detector data
